	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity in Algorithms</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a critical concept in computer science, referring to how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. When evaluating an algorithm's efficiency, we seek to understand its time complexity to determine whether it can handle large inputs in a reasonable time frame. An efficient algorithm minimizes time complexity, ensuring faster execution even as data scales up.</p>
	<p>The second key consideration is <b>Space Complexity</b>, which measures how much memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. Space Complexity is typically expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the memory requirement grows linearly with the size of the input. This is particularly important in environments with limited memory resources, as optimizing Space Complexity can ensure that an algorithm remains scalable and does not consume excessive memory.</p>
